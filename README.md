# play with inline assembly Rust

Support for inline assembly is provided via the asm! and global_asm! macros. It can be used to embed handwritten assembly in the assembly output generated by the compiler.

Support for inline assembly is stable on the following architectures:

* x86 and x86-64
* ARM
* AArch64
* RISC-V
* LoongArch

The compiler will emit an error if asm! is used on an unsupported target.
